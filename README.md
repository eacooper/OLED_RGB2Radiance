Uses functions for display simulation within the ISETBIO toolbox.

This script is verified to work with ISETBIO release v0.1-alpha, which can be downloaded from https://github.com/isetbio/isetbio/releases/tag/v0.1-alpha.

The latest version of ISETBIO, which may or may not work with this script, can be found at https://github.com/isetbio

ISETBIO must be placed in the MATLAB path for the tutorial to work.
